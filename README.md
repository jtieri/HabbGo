# HabbGo

An emulation of Habbo Hotel as it was in the early to mid 2000's when its client was made in Macromedia's Director
& powered in the web by the Shockwave plugin (RIP)

HabbGo is extremely experimental and is a project I started when I was in college but never finished. I will be 
reworking the project and breathing some new life into it over time.

# Goals

- [ ] To document the FUSE protocol, which was a custom application layer protocol over TCP powering HH
- [ ] Write a clean and easy to read code base for documenting how the game worked
- [ ] Create the means for simulating the various scripting tricks and hax
- [ ] Make the server/client easy to setup and deploy without Shockwave woes
- [ ] Configure both FUSEv0.1.0 & FUSEv0.2.0 in one environment to allow emulation of all Shockwave clients
